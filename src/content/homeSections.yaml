    Team bi0s (also known as Amrita bi0s) is a community of passionate college students,
    who have come together for the cause of making the world a safer place by
    contributing to the security community, while achieving excellence in security research.

    The team operates on a principle where the senior members of the club individually
    mentor the junior members. This enables the juniors to learn at a much faster rate, as they dont have to face the challenges their seniors had to face.

    Founded in 2008 by our mentor Shri Vipin Pavithran, over the years bi0s has been renowned as one of the leading CTF teams in India, with about 30 active members. The club is run by the students themselves, with the help of research scholars, alumni, and faculties.

    Team bi0s primarily participates in [Capture The Flag](https://ctftime.org/ctf-wtf/) (**CTF**) competitions & has been consistently ranked the **number one** team in India since 2016 [according to CTFtime](https://ctftime.org/stats/2019/IN). We regularly post write-ups of CTF challenges on our blog [here](https://blog.bi0s.in/).

    The team members also engage actively in **security research**. This is evident from the fact that our members have found several security issues in a variety of softwares such as Virtualisation Software, Content Management Systems, QnA Forums, Operating Systems etc. You can view a full list [here]().

    Driven by the vision to make **security education** easily accessible in India, members of our team go around places such as Schools, Universities and Industries to deliver **security trainings** and **workshops** ranging from very basic topics to cutting edge security research. We also maintain a [wiki](https://wiki.bi0s.in/) for people to get started with security.

    We organise the following CTFs every year:  
    + InCTF Internationals    
    + InCTF Nationals  
    + InCTF Junior
    + BSides Delhi CTF  

    You can read about them in detail [here]()

    Some of the members are also involved in [creating]() tools and contributing to open source projects such as NetBSD, qemu, radare, sagemath etc.

    Currently, the team is ranked [19th](https://ctftime.org/stats/2019) among 14,292 academic and professional teams worldwide and has been ranked first in India since 2016! bi0s has also been invited to compete with other international teams in a variety of onsite CTFs such as [Positive Hack Days](), [CSAW](), [Nullcon]() and [ISITDTU]().

    Our security research has yielded a [number of CVEs]() in various software vendors, with severity ranging from medium to critical. Every year a few of our members also get selected for the prestigious Google Summer of Code with organisations such as NetBSD, OWASP etc.

    Members of our team have also been selected to **deliver talks** at top tier security conferences like DEFCON, Troopers and other community-based security conferences such as BSides and Nullcon. In addition to this, the members have **received scholarships** to attend conferences like BlackHat, Troopers, Hack.lu etc.
